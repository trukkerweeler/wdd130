  <h2>Esdras 11</h2>
  <p>Then saw I a dream, and, behold, there came up from the sea an eagle, which had twelve feathered wings, and three heads. </p>
  <p>And I saw, and, behold, she spread her wings over all the earth, and all the winds of the air blew on her, and were gathered together.</p>
  <p>And I beheld, and out of her feathers there grew other contrary feathers; and they became little feathers and small.</p>
  <p>But her heads were at rest: the head in the midst was greater than the other, yet rested it with the residue.</p>
  <p>Moreover I beheld, and, lo, the eagle flew with her feathers, and reigned upon earth, and over them that dwelt therein.</p>
  <p>And I saw that all things under heaven were subject unto her, and no man spake against her, no, not one creature upon earth.</p>
  <p>And I beheld, and, lo, the eagle rose upon her talons, and spake to her feathers, saying,</p>
  <p>Watch not all at once: sleep every one in his own place, and watch by course:</p>
  <p>But let the heads be preserved for the last.</p>
  <p>And I beheld, and, lo, the voice went not out of her heads, but from the midst of her body.</p>
  <p>And I numbered her contrary feathers, and, behold, there were eight of them.</p>
  <p>And I looked, and, behold, on the right side there arose one feather, and reigned over all the earth;</p>
  <p>And so it was, that when it reigned, the end of it came, and the place thereof appeared no more: so the next following stood up. and reigned, and had a great time;</p>
