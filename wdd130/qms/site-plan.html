      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>Manufacturers need to manage process waste to maintain profitability in their manufacturing processes. How is waste measured easily? This website will provide an effective means to monitor process performance with simple menus and an easy-to-use interface. Popular process measurements include product nonconformance, corrective action, and internal audit processes. Processes can then be easily reviewed for improvements, maximizing profitability at this super competitive manufacturing environment. Compliance to industry Quality Management System standards such as ISO9001 can be easily demonstrated.

      <h3>Inspection</h3>
      <p>
        The Standard requires Monitoring and Measurement of Product. This is a lengthy technical phrase that means the product must be inspected. You may hear auditors reqently say -- Trust but verify--. Inspection verifies that the product is conforming.

      <h3>Nonconformity</h3>
      <p>
        Nonconformity is the process for dispositioning product that does not meet design requirements. Sometimes defects are such that they do not affect the form, fit, or function for its intended use. Nonconformities should also consider the effect to customer satisfaction. Personnel making material review decisions must be trained and authorized.
